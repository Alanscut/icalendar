iCalendar 0.11 (2005-11-08)
===========================

* Changed component .from_string to use types_factory instead of
  hardcoding entries to 'inline'

* Changed UTC tzinfo to a singleton so the same one is used everywhere

* Made the parser more strict by using regular expressions for key
  name, param name and quoted/unquoted safe char as per the RFC

* Added some tests from the schooltool icalendar parser for better
  coverage

* Be more forgiving on the regex for folding lines

* Allow for multiple top-level components on .from_string

* Fix vWeekdays, wasn't accepting relative param (eg: -3SA vs -SA)

* vDDDTypes didn't accept negative period (eg: -P30M)

* '\N' is also acceptable as newline on content lines, per RFC


iCalendar 0.10 (2005-04-28)
===========================

* moved code to codespeak.net subversion.

* reorganized package structure so that source code is under 'src'
  directory. Non-package files remain in distribution root.

* redid doc/*.py files as doc/*.txt, using more modern doctest. Before
  they were .py files with big docstrings.

* added test.py testrunner, and tests/test_icalendar.py that picks up
  all doctests in source code and doc directory, and runs them, when
  typing:

  python2.3 test.py

* renamed iCalendar to lower case package name, lowercased,
  de-pluralized and shorted module names, which are mostly
  implementation detail.

* changed tests so they generate .ics files in a temp directory, not
  in the structure itself.
