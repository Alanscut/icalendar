
iCalendar 0.10 (under development)
==================================

* move code to codespeak.net

* reorganize package structure so that source code is under 'src'
  directory. Non-package files remain in distribution root.

* redid doc/*.py files as doc/*.txt, using more modern doctest. Before
  they were .py files with big docstrings.

* added test.py testrunner, and tests/test_icalendar.py that picks up
  all doctests in source code and doc directory, and runs them, when
  typing:

  python2.3 test.py
