iCalendar 1.1 (unreleased)
==========================

* Fixed a bug in caselessdicts popitem.
  (thanks to Michael Smith <msmith@fluendo.com>)
  
* The RFC 2445 was a bit unclear on how to handle line folding when it
  happened to be in the middle of a UTF-8 character. This has been clarified
  in the following discussion:
  http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/ietf-calsify/2006-August/001126.html
  And this is now implemented in iCalendar. It will not fold in the middle
  of a UTF-8 character, but may fold in the middle of a UTF-8 composing
  character sequence.
