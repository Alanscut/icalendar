* several errors in Caseless dict's to_ical()
    TypeError: sequence item 0: expected bytes, str found
* data_encode should return strings vom dicts without enclosed 'b's
  (this is the main source of failed tests at the moment)
* base64 encoding needs to be redone
===============================================================
* should to_ical() not better return unicode? (not bytes?)
