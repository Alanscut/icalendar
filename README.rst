About this fork which is not a fork anymore
===========================================

Aim of this fork (not fork anymore, read further) was to bring this package up
to date with latest icalendar `RFC`_ specification as part of
`plone.app.event`_ project which goal is to bring recurrent evens to `Plone`_.

After some thoughts we (Plone developers involved with `plone.app.event`_) send
a suggestion to icalendar-dev@codespeak.net to take over mainaining of
`icalendar`_. Nobody object and since version 2.2 we are back to development.
